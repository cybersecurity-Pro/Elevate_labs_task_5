# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Introduction
In this task, I captured and analyzed live network traffic to develop a deeper understanding of network protocols and packet-level communication. The primary objective was to identify at least three different protocols in real-time network traffic, understand their function, and observe the interaction between my computer and external servers. This exercise enhanced my practical skills in network traffic analysis and protocol identification.

**Key learning outcomes included:**
- Hands-on experience with packet capture and filtering.
- Identification of different protocols such as DNS, TCP, ICMP, and TLS/HTTPS.
- Understanding the flow of network traffic between a client and server.
- Familiarity with Wireshark’s interface, filters, and packet analysis capabilities.

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark** – a network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect live traffic.
- **Command Prompt / PowerShell** – to generate network traffic via ping commands.
- **Web Browser (Chrome)** – to access websites like YouTube, generating HTTP/HTTPS and DNS traffic.
