# Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## üìå Introduction
This task was completed as part of my cybersecurity internship. The objective was to perform a packet capture using **Wireshark**, analyze the traffic for different protocols (DNS, TCP, ICMP, TLS), and document the entire process in a structured walkthrough. The activity demonstrates practical knowledge of packet capturing, filtering, and protocol-level analysis.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
This repository contains the following files and folders:

- **Report.md**  
  The main file of this repository. It provides a detailed walkthrough of all steps performed during the task, including packet captures, protocol filtering, and analysis with screenshots.

- **Screenshots/**  
  A folder containing all the screenshots taken during the execution of this task. Each screenshot corresponds to specific steps described in the report.

- **Capture.pcapng**  
  The raw packet capture file generated during the task. This file was used for protocol filtering and analysis in Wireshark.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: The `.pcap` file was captured on my personal system for demonstration purposes. No credentials were entered during capture, and the file mainly includes routine traffic such as DNS queries, TCP sessions, ICMP ping tests, and TLS packets.*

## ‚úÖ How to Use
1. Open the **Report.md** file for the full walkthrough.  
2. Refer to the **Screenshots** folder for visual references.  
3. Load the **Capture.pcap** file into Wireshark if you wish to follow along with the analysis.
